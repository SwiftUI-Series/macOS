# macOS

If you've been holding off building macOS app because learning AppKit just seemed like too much work, SwiftUI is here to help you out! Build powerful, useful and fun apps to help people in their (professional) workflow on macOS.

- Make a small macOS utility app that showcases a macOS API you think deserves attention
- It can be a menu bar app, a full blown todo list, a new Maps app, a calculator or something completely different. 
- macOS has a ton of interesting APIs that let you create very useful and powerful apps, surprise us!
- Try to use as many built-int SwiftUI components as you can, extra points for combining some together.
- Upload your code to a public GitHub repo and add it to this repo
